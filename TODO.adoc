- Add uncategorised tag
- Figure out some way to warn about overwritting tags.html, possibly:
  - Change directory structure
  - Insert warnings or programmatically enforced rules on draft creation/renaming
- Implement unit tests (with makefile?)
- fix update_tag_hunk --remmove to only accept on post (or to accept several)
- fix variable name nesting (having enough underscores to avoid name collision)
- add guide for how to customise
- figure out solution for die in api.sh
